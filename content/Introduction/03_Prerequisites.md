The course is intended for those who are familiar with the shell and `R` language.

We will also assume that you are familiar with mapping and analysing bulk RNA-seq data as well as with the commonly available computational tools.

* If a refresher is needed for Unix command line (hopefully not), please go over [this tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) and its [companion cheatsheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php).
* Getting down to basics: an introduction to the fundamentals of R ([courtesy of Mark Ravinet](markravinet.github.io/Introduction.html)).
* Gentle introduction to `R/Biocondutor`: [here](https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops/introduction-to-bioconductor-annotation-resources.html)
* For a full in-depth guide of `Bioconductor` ecosystem: read the comprehensive `R/Bioconductor` book from Kasper D. Hansen available under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license [[PDF]](/{{<myPackageUrl>}}docs/bioconductor.pdf)
