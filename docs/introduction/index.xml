      <description>Jacques Serizay
Dates TBD (around Sept./Oct. 2021)
Where This course will be held online.
Overview This course will introduce biologists and bioinformaticians to the field of single-cell RNA sequencing. We will cover a range of software and analysis workflows that extend over the spectrum from the best practices in the filtering scRNA-seq data
to the downstream analysis of cell clusters and temporal ordering. This course will help the attendees gain accurate insights in pre-processing, analysis and interpretation of scRNA-seq data.</description>

      <description>Rstudio offers a graphical interface to facilitate the interaction between a user and an underlying programming language (this is sometimes called IDE, or integrated development environment). It can be very useful when a user is not necessarily proficent with command line-based computing. However, such graphical interfaces are not always able to connect to services such as AWS.
Since most of the preliminary analysis we do is on AWS, we&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to use Rtudio directly from there.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix and the R scripting language.
We will also assume that you are familiar with mapping and analysing bulk RNA-seq data as well as with the commonly available computational tools.
 If a refresher is needed for Unix command line (hopefully not), please go over this tutorial and its companion cheatsheet . Getting down to basics: an introduction to the fundamentals of R (courtesy of Mark Ravinet ).</description>
